<p>Laravel has been updating since I created this course, and it has changed a little so this article will point out some things you need to watch out for going forward with this course.&nbsp; </p><p>I'm using <strong>Laravel version 5.2</strong> so in one of the videos I recommend installing this version, <strong>BUT you don't have to do that, you can start the course in the newest version. </strong>We start upgrading to different versions in section 33 of the course but I know there are some of you that wish to start on the newest versions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Want to start in the latest laravel version?</strong>&nbsp;No problem, then in the next video don't put the version number when using the command and just leave it blank like I&nbsp;do below.</p><p><br></p><p>This the command you will use in the next video, this command will install that specific <strong>version 5.2.29</strong></p><p><br></p><p><code><strong>composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel cms 5.2.29</strong></code></p><p><br></p><p><strong>To install the latest version just omit the version like this:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><code><strong>composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel cms </strong></code></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Major Change?</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>In the newer versions (<strong>anything above 5.3</strong>) there is a new folder called <strong>routes</strong>.</p><p><strong>So.</strong>..... If you are using a NEWER&nbsp;version of Laravel there is a new folder called<strong> routes</strong></p><p>When you see me in <strong>section 4</strong> I'm using a file called <strong>routes.php </strong>explaining how routes work, that files does NOT exist on new versions so all you have to do is:&nbsp;</p><p>Go to <code> project-folder -&gt;&nbsp;routes -&gt;&nbsp;wep.php</code></p><p>And continue writing everything I write in routes.php but you write it in <strong>wep.php</strong> which is inside the routes folder in the newer versions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to see a video of the folder structure between version 5.2 and the newer versions you can watch a lecture called <strong>Upgrading - Extra folders in this version </strong>in section 33, but of course this is optional.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Error you might get after installing Laravel.</strong></h4><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-06-30_03-03-53-ac08bac772160d480231a083b1e1338e.png"></figure><p><br></p><h4><strong>Solution</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>If you get this error come back here :) </p><p>Go to the root folder of your project and change permissions.
