<p>So when I created this course Laravel was in version 5.2 and I just kept adding updates and upgrading the application by adding lectures.</p><p>This section here is <strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Even though the application we create in this section it's older<strong> it is still applicable.</strong> You can use 97% of this application features in the new versions and it would still work.</p><p><strong>Personal Thought: </strong>If I were you I&nbsp;would look at the name of the lectures, and sections and check to see if there is something you want to learn to do in your projects. When you find something, then try the implementation in the new version, if not at least it can give you ideas on how to do it; that's my opinion.</p><p><br></p>
